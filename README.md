**Cost-rate for an hybrid inspection and age-based policy with inspector assignments**

Welcome to the source code for our app in Streamlit. This app computes the cost-rate for an hybrid inspection and age-based policy with inspector assignments. This application was developed by Victor H. R. Lima, Cristiano A. V. Cavalcante and Phuc Do.

This tool aims to aid decision-makers in maintenance on the importance of the right choosing of maintenance actions, their times and the personel reponsible to them.

We ask for a little bit patience because sometimes the app is putted in standby due to unactivity time. So, you need to click on "Yes, get this app back up!".
